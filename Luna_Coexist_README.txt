USE - whether to use focal or not (have some mysteries I couldn't figure out)
FOCAL_HT_mm - focal height in mm
Focal_BD - number of buds on focal taken at time 3 and 5 (time presence/absence was just recorded so the previous value was used)
Focal_FL - number of flowerss on focal taken at time 3 and 5 (time presence/absence was just recorded so the previous value was used)
Focal_FR- number of fruits on focal taken at time 3 and 5 (time presence/absence was just recorded so the previous value was used)
FOCAL_REP_EFFORT - focal reproductive effort for time 3 -5

Per_Litt - percent litter in the ring
Per_Bare - percent bare in the ring
Per_Plant - percent green plant cover in the ring
Neigh_per_BD - percentage of neighbors with buds
Neigh_per_FL- percentage of neighbors with flowers
Neigh_per_FR- percentage of neighbors with fruits
ALIVE_Y.N - is the focal alive or not (NA is used for missing plants)
NOTES - notes for time 1
NOTES.2 - notes for time 2
NOTES.3 - notes for time 3
NOTES.4 - notes for time 4

Relationship between files, if important for context: NA

Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: we have soil temp data over a few days for at the large rock lunas and under a shrub and in a control setting.

If data was derived from another source, list source: NA

If there are there multiple versions of the dataset, list the file updated, when and why update was made: old files are held by TEM in old.files folder.

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: <Include links or references to publications or other documentation containing experimental design or protocols used in data collection>

Neighborhood size was a 4 inch diameter ring surround the focal plant (marked with a colored toothpick). Species and quantity of all the neighbors in the ring was recorded along with bare, litter, and plant percent cover. Height of the focal was taken at each timestep along with the average height of each of the neighbor species. Biomass was taken on any remaining focal plants left at time 5. 

Methods for processing the data: <describe how the submitted data were generated from the raw or collected data>
